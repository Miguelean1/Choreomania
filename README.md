## Description

‘Choreomania’ is a group project developed for the Client Web Development class. We have tried to recreate a classic Wheel of Doom, but adding some sparks and techno! 

In addition to the usual specs on this kind of games, we have developed some exciting new features like:

* A very surprising plot, a story you won´t forget!
* A complete audio logic with in-game narrative.
* Original raffle system with random picks, and persistence over time.
* Desktop and mobile design.
* A very big set of tests (ok, this one is not SO exciting, but it IS very interesting).

  Will you be the chosen one? or just another in the line?
